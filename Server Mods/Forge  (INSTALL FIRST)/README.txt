Make sure you have Java SE downloaded, then double click and hit "install client", open minecraft launcher and launch
with forge to ensure it works. Mods can only be downloaded after you have Forge.

To get mods, go to the "Mods" tab on the title screen of mc after you've launched it with Forge. Click on "Open Mods Folder", drag and drop
the mod files outside this folder (.jar files) into the "mods" folder that opens. Don't try dragging and dropping all the mods at once, do 4-5
at a time and relaunch minecraft to ensure the mods work.
